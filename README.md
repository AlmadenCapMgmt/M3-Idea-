# M3-Idea-
Idea for a fully decentralized version of our M2 model, leveraging oracles. 

However, research has indicated that signal data for our needs (Fed rate policy adjustments, M2 supply deviations, and BTC on-chain metrics) are not currently available via oracle networks (such as Chainlink).

Per the initial research, Claude concluded: 

"Bottom Line

Your API-based model is the pragmatic, cost-effective solution that actually works today. The oracle ecosystem simply hasnâ€™t caught up to the sophisticated macro analysis your model performs.

The decentralized oracle vision is compelling for the future, but right now, centralized APIs + smart execution beats expensive, limited on-chain oracles for strategic Bitcoin investment modeling."
